## Deploying a Database Server Manually on GCP
This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL on both Windows and Linux VM.

**1. Setting up PostgreSQL on  Windows Instance**
- To set up a PostgreSQL database on a Windows VM, you can refer to the following [link](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/) for detailed installation steps.

- For installing a MySQL database on a Windows VM, refer to the steps outlined in this [guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/windows-installation.html).

- To install an  SQL database on a Windows VM, follow the instructions provided in this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16).

**2. Setting up PostgreSQL on Linux Instance**

- Before installing PostgreSQL on Linux instance, ensure you review the [prerequisites](https://help.boldbi.com/deploying-bold-bi/deploying-in-linux/prerequisites-linux/). You can then use the package manager to [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/).
